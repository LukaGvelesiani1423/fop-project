# fop-project

## Description
A simple interpreter for a minimal programming language subset. The project will support basic constructs like variable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditionals, and iterative control flow.

## Language Choice
**Golang**

## Features
- Support for variable assignment (`x = 5`)
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Basic input/output (print statement)

## Algorithms Implemented
Here are a few algorithms we will implement to test the interpreter:
1. Sum of First N Numbers
2. Factorial of N
3. GCD of Two Numbers
4. Reverse a Number
5. Check if a Number is Prime
6. Check if a Number is Palindrome
7. Find the Largest Digit in a Number
8. Sum of Digits
9. Multiplication Table
10. Nth Fibonacci Number

## Language Subset Supported by Interpreter
This interpreter supports the following constructs:
- **Variables**: Assignment of values to variables (e.g., `x = 5`).
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
- **Conditionals**: `if` and `else` statements for conditional execution.
- **Loops**: `while` loops for repeating operations.
- **Print Statements**: Print output to the console.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LukaGvelesiani1423/fop-project.git
    cd fop-project
    ```
2. Compile the Java code:
    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    ```
3. Run the interpreter with a sample program (e.g., `sum_of_first_n_numbers.txt`):
    ```bash
    java Interpreter sum_of_first_n_numbers.txt
    ```

## Sample Program

Example of a program that sums the first 10 numbers:
