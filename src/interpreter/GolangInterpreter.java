        //Purpose: GolangInterpreter is the code executor, it gives meaning to the AST.
        //Code: It will need code to:
        //Traverse the AST nodes by means of a visit method,
        // calling different methods depending on the type of the node
        //Implement specific logic for PROGRAM nodes, ASSIGNMENT
        // nodes, BINARY_OPERATION nodes, UNARY_OPERATION nodes,
        // IF_STATEMENT nodes, WHILE_STATEMENT nodes, PRINT_STATEMENT
        // nodes, and BLOCK nodes.
        //Create a symbolTable to store variables and their values.
        //Evaluate expressions recursively by means of an
        // evaluateExpression method, calling different methods to
        // evaluate different types of expressions, for example,
        // integers, variables, binary or unary operations.
        //Handle +,-,*,/,%,==,!=,<,>,<=,>= operations in the code.
        //Use the ErrorReporter class to report any runtime error,
        // such as division by zero, or undefined variables.
