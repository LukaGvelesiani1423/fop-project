    //Purpose: Token defines the vocabulary of a language (golang).
    //
    //Code: It will need code to:
    //Define an enum to represent all possible tokens (e.g., INTEGER, PLUS, IF, IDENTIFIER).
    //Create class members such as the TokenType, value of the token,
    //and the line and column where the token appeared in the source file.
    //Create constructors to initialize values of token class members.
    //Implement a toString method for debugging purposes.
