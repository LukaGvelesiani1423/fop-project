public class ASTNode {
    //Purpose: ASTNode defines the structure of your program's code in memory
    //Code: It will need code to:
    //Define an enum NodeType to represent different types of nodes of your
    // program. e.g. PROGRAM, ASSIGNMENT, BINARY_OPERATION, IF_STATEMENT
    //Create class members to hold the type, the Token associated with the
    // node, the value of the node if any, and a list of child nodes.
    //Create constructors with different parameters to initialize all
    // values in the class.
    //Implement toString method to debug.
