public class Parser {
    //Purpose: Parser is the syntax checker and AST builder.
    //Code: It will need code to:
    //Consume the list of Token objects from the Lexer.
    //Implement methods to parse statements and call the
    // appropriate methods to parse different types of statements,
    // such as variable assignments, while loops, if statements,
    // print statements, and blocks of code.
    //Implement methods to parse expressions, taking into account
    // operator precedence using recursive methods such as
    // parseComparison, parseTerm, and parseFactor.
    //Handle parenthesis in expressions.
    //Create ASTNode objects to represent the different
    // operations and statements in the code, including the
    // token, type and child nodes.
    //Return the root node of the generated AST.
    //Use the ErrorReporter class to report syntax errors
    // found during parsing if there are any syntax errors.
